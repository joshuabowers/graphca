A collection of constants and inverse functions calls shift mode home, as well as more ways to group expressions. The toggle button for shift mode is identified by the `⌥` symbol.

- <button class="normal shift"><span class="primary"><span>nCr</span></span></button>: Combinations; inserts `C(`; expects two arguments separated by a comma, followed by a closing paranthesis. (see: [Combinatorial](/graphca/functions/combinatorial.html) for more detail)
- <button class="normal shift"><span class="primary"><span>ψ</span></span></button>: Digamma and polygamma; inserts `ψ(`; expects one or two arguments and a closing paranthesis. (refer: [Factorial](/graphca/functions/factorial.html))
- `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`: square and curly brackets are alternatives for parentheses. Note, functions only accept parentheses.
- `√`: [Square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root); note that the expression `√x` is equal to `x^0.5`
- `x`<sup>`-1`</sup>: [Reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse), equivalent to dividing `1` by the argument.
- `EE`: [Scientific E notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation) for entering massive or tiny numbers.
- The [Constants](/graphca/functions/constants.html)

The `Ins` and Integral keys are currently functionless; inputing them will likely raise an error.

Note that shift-mode, like the alphabetic and trigonometric modes, are toggled: they remain active after activating a key within their trays. To return to Default, re-activate the shift-mode key.
