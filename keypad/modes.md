title: Modes
---

GraphCa's Keypad operates on a concept called "Modes", which designate which key-tray is currently on display. Each tray has a different selection of keys available. This allows the calculator to provide more functionality with the same number of keys.

To switch to a different mode, you will need to press its associated toggle key: these are presented in orange. Currently, there are 5 different modes available in the app:

1. Default
2. Shift
3. Lowercase Alphabetic
4. Uppercase Alphabetic
5. Trigonometric

When a mode is active, its associated key will glow. All keys relevant to that mode will change their displays to show their new functionality. Finally, all keys which do not have functionality in that mode will be disabled.

To switch to another mode, either toggle one of the other mode keys, or toggle the current mode key to return to the Default mode.
