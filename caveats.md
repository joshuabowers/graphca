GraphCa is developed by one person; it relies upon fundamental data-types provided by your browser. Taken together, it might be buggy or lossy; for mission-critical applications---such as, but not limited to, launching probes at other planets in the solar system, or calculating tolerances for heavy machinery which might harm folk---please do not rely solely upon GraphCa. Reasonable testing has ensured that supported mathematical functionality is accurate, but only up to about 15 decimal places.
