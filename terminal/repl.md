title: Meet the REPL
---

GraphCa operates on a read-eval-print loop, or [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop); that is, it allows the user to input expressions (read), which are then executed (eval), and the results are presented to the user (print). This process repeats.

The primary input and output of this REPL is focused on a part of the user interface called the terminal: users are presented with a prompt for building input, which is collected within this area; upon executing the input, the output will be printed within the terminal. In desktop and landscape environments, this will be present on the lower left corner for the screen; in mobile and portrait environments, this will be located mid-screen between the graph screen and keypad.

The terminal keeps a history of all inputs the user has executed over the course of the current session. These will be prefixed with a number, indicating the count of loops as of that input. For any given executed input, the response generated by GraphCa will be presented on the next line after a thick arrow (`=>`). On the response line is also a button that allows that response to be graphed.

The current line of input starts with a `Î»` prompt.
