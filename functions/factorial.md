The [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) is a recursively defined function on a single argument, typically calculated by the recurrence:

```
n! = n * (n-1)!
```

For all [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) `n`. To calculate the factorial in GraphCa, enter the value you wish to use as argument, then activate the `!` key.

Note that the factorial function is only defined on the natural numbers; any fractional, negative, or complex inputs are, per the recurrence, undefined.

### Gamma Function

The [Gamma Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function) exists as an extension of the factorial function to most of the numbers factorial cannot calculate. With the exception of the negative integers, for which the function asymptotically approaches an infinite value, the Gamma function is otherwise defined on all real and complex inputs. 

To find the value of the gamma function for a given input, `n`, activate the <button class="normal"><span class="primary"><span>𝚪</span></span></button>, the value `n`, and a closing parenthesis:

```
𝚪(n)
```

The gamma function will generate the values of the factorial function for natural inputs, according to the following identity:

```
n! = 𝚪(n+1)
```
