title: Clearing Graphs
---

Currently, the only method for clearing a plot from the graph viewport is to remove all plots from the viewport. When any expression is plotted, a button will appear as an overlay on the viewport; activating this button will cause the viewport to remove all plotted graphs.

Removed plots can be replotted on an per-response basis.
