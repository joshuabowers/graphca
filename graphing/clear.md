title: Clearing Graphs
---

GraphCa supports three ways of removing plots from the graph viewport:

### Clear Everything

When any expression is plotted, a button will appear as an overlay on the viewport; activating this button will cause the viewport to remove all plotted graphs.

Removed plots can be replotted on an per-response basis.

### Unplot a specific expression

You might notice the symbol on the plot button next to a terminal response changes after plotting: the changed button can be used to remove the plot for that specific expression from the graph.

### Forgetting an expression

When an expression is forgotten from terminal history via the remove button, it will automatically remove any associated plots from the graph viewport.
